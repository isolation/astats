# astats - a frontend for lenora

This is an unholy mix of GPLv2 and QPL code so
I'm sure someone will find a reason to be pissed
off with how I'm distributing it.

GPLv2 code: www/bargraph.php

QPL code: www/jpgraph/

## Installation

Place the www/ directory somewhere web-accessible.

## Configuration

Copy www/example.inc.php to www/lenora.inc.php

Change the database path and default network name in
lenora.inc.php to match your Auto's configuration.
